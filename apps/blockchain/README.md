# Hardhat Project

This project is based on Hardhat. Hardhat will compile, test, deploy the Solidity smart contracts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

Compile the smart contracts:
```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

Run the smart contract test suite:
```shell
npx hardhat test
```

Create TypeScript stubs for use with Ethers.js:
```shell
npx hardhat typechain
```

Starting a local test net:
```shell
npx hardhat node
```

Deployment of the smart contracts to local test net (test net must be running):
```shell
npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
```
